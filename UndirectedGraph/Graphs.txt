Graph connectivity problem: DFS-based solution vs Union Find
In theory, DFS is faster than union find because it provides a constant-time gurantee, which union find does not;
In practice, this difference is negligible, and union find is faster because it does not have to build a full
representation of the graph. More important, union find is an online algorithm(we can check whether two vertices are
connected in near-constant time at any point, even while adding edges), whereas the DFS solution must first preprocess
the graph.
Therefore, we prefer union find when determining connectivity is our only task or when we have a large number of queries
intermixed with edge insertions but may find the DFS solution more appropriate for use in a graph ADT because it makes 
efficient use of existing infrastructure.
